# NewsAggregator

This is a news-aggregator. The admin can add url of news feeds of news websites into the 'Feed' part of this website. When that is done, anyone who opens this websites will be able to see the different news articles, in that particular feed. Each news article will show a heading, its small description and option to view the full news article which will take the user to its official site. Here, I've added two feeds from a news website 'Times of India'. So, we are able to see the news articles in order of date and time in the home page, from these feeds.
